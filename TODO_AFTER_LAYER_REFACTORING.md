- add 3dtiles v1.1 code to refactored layers (+ attempt to use shader instead of alpha color)

- cleanup translations
- rename group ids
- shared order_of_properties / maybe for every layer?
- custom properties (-> detailsUrl)?

TODOs in Code


Nils to Test:
- Background behavior
- Slicing behavior
- Drawing lines on underground layers
